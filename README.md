# generic-class

this will contain a generic class,,so that we can create an object ,
whose instance variables can take any type of data
with out need to typecast explicitly bcz we mention the type of data while we creating object
we can initiate class with diff data types
when we need to work with diff datatypes we can take generic classes
which has advantages:--1)code reusability:->we neednt create seprte classes for seperate data types ,
the same code can work with diff datatypes
2)typesafety
